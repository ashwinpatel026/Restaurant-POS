## üîß Database Migration

The database schema has been automatically updated:

- ‚úÖ Old tables (`tbl_availability`, `tbl_availability_schedule`) have been **dropped**
- ‚úÖ New table (`tbl_Time_Events`) has been **created**
- ‚úÖ Prisma Client regenerated
- ‚úÖ No manual SQL required

---

## üìù Notes

1. **BigInt ID**: The ID field uses `BigInt` to support very large numbers of events
2. **Time Storage**: Time fields use PostgreSQL's `TIME` type (HH:MM:SS)
3. **Date Storage**: Date fields use PostgreSQL's `DATE` type
4. **Decimal Precision**: Price fields use `Decimal(18,2)` for accurate currency calculations
5. **Nullable Fields**: Most fields are optional to provide flexibility

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Event not showing?

- Check if `isActive` is set to 1
- Verify date range includes today's date
- Ensure at least one day is configured

### Price adjustments not working?

- Verify the price adjustment fields are populated
- Check that the event is active
- Ensure the current time falls within the event's schedule

### Can't create event?

- Event Code must be unique
- Event Code and Event Name are required
- Check console for validation errors

---

## üéâ Benefits of New System

1. **Simpler Structure**: One table instead of two related tables
2. **More Flexible**: Support for both amount and percentage pricing
3. **Easier to Manage**: All event configuration in one place
4. **Better Performance**: Fewer database joins required
5. **Enhanced Features**: Support for seasonal events with date ranges
